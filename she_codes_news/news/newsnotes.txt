Me in Views - trying to create author view
context = ['author'] = CustomUser.objects.all().order_by('user')[:4]


context ['author_name'] = CustomUser.objects.filter(author__username=CustomUser)


 author = models.ForeignKey(
        get_user_model(),
        on_delete=models.CASCADE,
    )

ForeignKey means that there is a list


All theat Djano is is the gate to let the data through.
